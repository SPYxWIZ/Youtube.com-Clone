# Youtube.com-Clone

The project is about a basic clone of the youtube home page with the help of HTML (hypertext markup language) and CSS (cascading style sheets).
Throughout the learning curve, I learnt various important topics like units, positions, flexbox, grid, media queries, etc.
The final clone is a responsive design with all the front end features present on a youtube home page like tooltips, window resizing, sidebar, auto-sizing saerch bar, etc.
The learning curve was quite short as I only went through the basic front-end languages.

This marks the journey of my web-development learning.
